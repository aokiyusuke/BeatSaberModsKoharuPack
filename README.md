# BeatSaberModsKoharuPack
I would like to inform you that this pack contains various Beat Saber Mods for PC/Steam, which I collect for my daughter Koharu as soon as possible after new versions are released. However, please note that this site does not apply to you if you are looking for Quest Modding.

Now, I want to make _an important announcement_ as a programmer with over 30 years of experience. 

* First and foremost, it is crucial to remind you that installing DLLs obtained from the internet directly can be unsafe since there are risks of spyware or virus. Therefore, if you are unsure about this, I suggest using BeatMods or ModAssistance instead. Nevertheless, using the Koharu Pack has its advantages, as multiple MODs can be installed at once and used slightly before they are officially released.

* Secondly, I want to emphasize that all mods included in this pack are not official, and I highly recommend switching to BeatMods (https://beatmods.com/#/mods) or ModAssistance (https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant/releases) once they start handling these releases.

* Thirdly, please note that none of the mods in this pack have been fully tested yet, so I cannot guarantee their performance.

* Lastly, I must inform you that using this pack is at your own risk, and there is no warranty. Please keep this in mind before installing any mods from the Koharu Pack.

Before I conclude, I would like to kindly request you to subscribe to my daughterâ€™s YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjiyZoL-4RWEeP4pB1uGaww). Your support will be highly appreciated.
