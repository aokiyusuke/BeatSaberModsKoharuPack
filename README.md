# BeatSaberModsKoharuPack
This pack contains releases of various Beat Saber Mods for PC/Steam.

I'm collecting Beat Saber Mods for my daughter, Koharu, as soon as possible after new versions are released.
Some mods have been modified or reworked for newer versions as needed.

Here's an *important announcement*.
* You must be aware that it is not safe to install DLLs obtained from internet directly, since there are risks to have spyware or virus. If you are unsure about this, use BeatMods or ModAssistance.  The advantage of using the Koharu Pack is that multiple MODs can be installed at once and you can use them slightly before they are officially released.
* All mods included in this pack are not official. Once BeatMods(https://beatmods.com/#/mods) or ModAssistance(https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant/releases) starts to handle these releases, I recommend you use them instead of this pack.
* None of them have been fully tested yet.
* There is no warranty. Use of this pack is at your own risk.

I would appreciate it if you would subscribe to my daughter's YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjiyZoL-4RWEeP4pB1uGaww).

# How to install

1. Backup your Beat Saber directory
2. Update Beat Saber and run once
3. Make sure Beat Saber and SteamVR finished
4. Unzip the contents of the release zip to your beat saver directory.
5. Execute IPA.EXE once
6. Run Beat Saber. OpenVR will show dialog box at first time in PC screen.
7. If MODs do not seem to work, check to see if `Old X.XX.X Plugins` backup folder exists and copy the contents of the backup to `Plugins` folder.
