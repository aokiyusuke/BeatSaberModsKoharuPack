# BeatSaberModsKoharuPack
This pack contains releases of various Beat Saber Mods.

I'm collecting Beat Saber Mods for my daughter, Koharu, as soon as possible after new versions are released.
Some mods have been modified or reworked for newer versions as needed.

Here's an important announcement.
* All mods included in this pack are not official. Once BeatMods(https://beatmods.com/#/mods) or ModAssistance(https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant/releases) starts to handle these releases, I recommend you use them instead of this pack.
* None of them have been fully tested yet.
* There is no warranty. Use of this pack is at your own risk.

I would appreciate it if you would subscribe to my daughter's YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjiyZoL-4RWEeP4pB1uGaww).

# How to install

2. Update Beat Saber and run once
3. Make sure Beat Saber and SteamVR finished
4. Unzip the contents of the release zip to your beat saver directory.
